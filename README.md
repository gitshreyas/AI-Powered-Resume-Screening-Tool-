 How It Works
1. Text Extraction

Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
Handles various document formats and encodings
Preprocesses text for NLP analysis

2. Information Extraction

Skills: Matches against comprehensive skill database
Experience: Uses regex patterns and spaCy NER
Education: Identifies degree levels and institutions
Contact Info: Extracts emails and phone numbers

3. Scoring Algorithm
The tool uses a weighted scoring system:

40% - Skill matching percentage
30% - Text similarity (TF-IDF cosine similarity)
30% - Experience requirement matching

4. Recommendation Engine

Highly Recommended (‚â•80%): Top candidates
Recommended (‚â•60%): Strong candidates
Consider (‚â•40%): Potential candidates
Not Recommended (<40%): Poor match
